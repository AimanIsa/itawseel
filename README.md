### Project Overview
	
1. Problem Statement

The IIUM students often face challenges when it comes to food delivery services on campus. Even though we already have the system specifically designed for this service, it is not efficient and there are two major problems when using this system. Firstly, the system is non-systematic, and it led to frustration for both students and runners; and secondly students are not aware of the exact price for the food they ordered. These problems also cause customer confusion and delay. Moreover, most students are unaware of the price of food items. the delivery fees and the additional fees if there are any special requests. Hence, this will result in financial surprises upon delivery payment and makes it difficult for students to manage their budget effectively.  

2. Project Objectives

-	To develop a mobile application with a multi-sided and have communication platform between runner and customer
-	To acknowledge students with the exact price food offer in IIUM cafeteria 
- To provide students with option to choose their preference of runner
